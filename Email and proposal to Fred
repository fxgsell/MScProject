Dear Fred,

We are emailing in regards to the proposal you requested on Friday and the assigned job roles for each member of the group.

Proposal 
The aim of our project is to implement a generic framework for an autonomous robot with 3D stereo vision producing real time point mapping as well as obstacle avoidance and depth perception. The software should also be able to identify objects and create approximations of them in the simulated environment. For the stereo vision we will be using the OpenCV open source library and C++ and for the programming as well as Prolog for the artificial intelligence program. For this project we will be testing on an 8 legged robot, which will be provided by the department. We will be using two standard webcams for the stereo vision. We will be adding a circuit board for the brain of the robot, which we will be programming. We hope it will be able to perform quickly, robustly and flexibly in a complex and previously unknown environment. 

The assigned job roles are as follows:

Marketing, webpage – Shelley, Liz 
Robot mechanics – Tim 
Programming of robot – Thomas, Tim, Liz  
Programming of brain – Francois, Shelley

Naturally each member will be contributing to all areas of the project to gain an overall understanding.
